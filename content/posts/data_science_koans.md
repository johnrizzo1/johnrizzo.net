Data Science is a vast field that encompasses various techniques and tools for extracting insights from data. One effective way to learn data science is through hands-on practice and problem-solving. Inspired by the concept of "koans" in programming, which are small exercises designed to teach specific concepts, I have created a set of Data Science Koans to help learners grasp essential data science concepts.

As an example, one of the koans focuses on data cleaning, where learners are provided with a messy dataset and are tasked with cleaning and preparing it for analysis. Another koan might involve exploratory data analysis, where learners explore a dataset to uncover patterns and insights.

For example, a simple koan meant to teach how to create numpy arrays is shown below:

```python
def create_simple_array():
    # TODO: Return np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    pass
```

Once the learner completes the koan, they can run a set of tests to validate their solution and ensure they have grasped the concept.  While this example is simplistic, the koans cover a wide range of topics, including data visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, and more.

Take a look at the repository and try out the koans to enhance your data science skills. Each koan comes with a set of tests to validate your solutions, making it easy to track your progress.  I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions for additional koans that could be included.  Feel free to contribute to the repository by adding new koans or improving existing ones.
