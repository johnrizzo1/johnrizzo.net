Kubernetes is a powerful platform for deploying and managing applications in a containerized environment. It provides the tools to automate deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts. This post will be short as I wanted to show off my latest creation and get your feedback.  I have created a Kubernetes MCP server that allows tools such as Claude Code to interact with Kubernetes clusters. This MCP server is designed to be a bridge between AI tools and Kubernetes, enabling seamless integration and management of containerized applications.

The MCP server is built using Python and Flask, providing a RESTful API that allows AI tools to interact with Kubernetes clusters. It supports various operations such as deploying applications, scaling services, and monitoring cluster health. The server can be easily deployed on any Kubernetes cluster, making it a versatile solution for integrating AI with containerized environments.
