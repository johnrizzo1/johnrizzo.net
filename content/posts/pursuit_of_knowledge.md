One of the most important things in life is the continuous pursuit of understanding—understanding ourselves, others, and the world around us. As a professional, I have always strived to grow, but I believe true growth comes from deepening our knowledge across all domains. There are endless questions to explore, and I can think of no greater pursuit than striving for a deeper understanding of all things.

For as long as I can remember, I have pushed myself professionally, never neglecting my academic pursuits. However, I have now decided to make structured learning a larger part of my life. As a result, I am embarking on my journey for higher education. My goal is to always be working toward one degree or another, using formal education as a way to focus and refine my knowledge.

Given my background in Computer Science and the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence, I have chosen to pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science with a focus on AI. I use the term _Artificial Intelligence_ rather than _Machine Learning_ or _Data Science_ because AI is the broader field that encompasses those disciplines as well as areas like robotics and cognitive modeling.

## Why AI, and Why Now?

I have followed AI developments for a long time but, until recently, did not see enough practical applications to justify a significant investment of my time. That has certainly changed—or has it?

The question I am exploring is: _What can we do with AI today?_ Not in some distant future where AI rules the world, but in the present—what real-world applications are already making an impact? Here are some of the most practical and successful use cases for AI today:

### **Machine Learning**

- Models that can learn from data  
- Fraud detection in banking and finance

### **Computer Vision**

- Self-driving cars
- Medical image analysis
- Object detection and facial recognition
- Image restoration and enhancement

### **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

- Writing assistants like Grammarly
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Sentiment analysis for social media and reviews
- Search engines and auto-complete features

### **Scientific Research**

- Data analysis in healthcare (e.g., the MIMIC dataset)
- Drug discovery and protein folding (e.g., AlphaFold)

### **Deep Learning**

- The foundation for large language models (LLMs)
- Advances in autonomous vehicles

### **Business Applications**

- Demand forecasting for inventory management and marketing
- Price optimization and dynamic pricing
- Personalized product recommendations

### **Speech Recognition**

- Text-to-speech and speech-to-text applications

### **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)**

- Automated data processing and workflow optimization

### **Social Media**

- Content recommendation and targeted advertising

### **Robotics**

- The Mars Rover and autonomous exploration
- Robots such as Boston Dynamics’ Spot
- Amazon’s warehouse automation

### **Finance & Trading**

- Large-scale market data analysis
- Portfolio optimization and stock screening
- Time series analysis for trading strategies

### The Rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)

Today, when people think of AI, they often think of applications powered by deep learning and large language models. These systems have unlocked capabilities that were unimaginable just a few years ago:

- Autonomous research and customer support agents
- Real-time language translation
- Code generation and software development assistance
- AI-driven content creation and brainstorming

While AI is still not a universal solution to all problems, it is increasingly proving its value across industries.

Join me on my journey as I explore the evolving landscape of AI. I’ll continue sharing my insights, especially on AI applications in finance and trading—though my interests extend far beyond. If there’s anything specific you’d like me to cover, let me know! What AI applications do you find most useful and engaging?
